# Working with a remote repository in GitHub

In this exercise, you'll create a remote repository at [GitHub.com](https://github.com). Once the repository has been created, you'll interact with the repository remotely.

> *Note*:  A GitHub account is required beyond this point. If you have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled on your GitHub account, you will need to generate a token for authentication. Refer to [Using two-factor authentication with the command line](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/authenticating-to-github/accessing-github-using-two-factor-authentication#using-two-factor-authentication-with-the-command-line) in the GitHub documentation.

## Creating a repository on GitHub

1. In a web browser, navigate to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in.
1. Find the **New repository** button or click the **+** icon in the upper right corner.
1. Provide a name and a description for your repository.
1. Set the repository to **Private** or **Public**. You can read more about the settings in [About repositories](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories) in the GitHub documentation.
1. Accept the default settings for all other options and do **not** initialize the repo with a README file.
1. Click **Create repository**.

You should see a screen that provides you with Quick Setup information.

## Setting up a git remote

Return to the course terminal to continue.

1. In the `git-intro` repository, you will create a new directory called `workshop`. Copy the `DEVNET.txt` file into the directory, and then initialize Git.

  ```bash
  cd ~/src/git-intro
  mkdir workshop
  cd workshop
  cp ../DEVNET.txt .
  git init
  ```

2. Use `git config` to add your GitHub.com account details. Replace `Sample User` and and `sample@example.com` with your real `GitHub.com` account details.

  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Sample User"
  git config --global user.email sample@example.com
  ```

3. You will now add a `remote` called `origin` to the repository. This links the local repository with the one that you created at GitHub.com. Use the `git remote` command and replace `<your_username>` and `<your_repo>` values with your actual `GitHub.com` details:

  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo>.git
  ```

4. Verify that you have a new remote by running the `git remote` command with the `--verbose` parameter:

  ```bash
  git remote --verbose
  ```

## Making and pushing changes to the remote

If you look at the history for this new repository in the new `workshop` folder, you'll see that there are no commits, and Git returns an error message:

```bash
git log

fatal: your current branch 'master' does not have any commits yet
```

Do not panic. Now you can repeat steps from the previous exercises to add files for tracking and messages for commits. Create


1. Within the `workshop` folder, create a new `DEVNET.txt` file and stage it for a commit:

  ```bash
  touch DEVNET.txt
  echo "I will master Git today." > DEVNET.txt
  git add DEVNET.txt
  ```

2. Commit the change, telling Git to start tracking that text file:

  ```bash
  git commit -m "Added the initial file"
  ```

  You will get a response similar to the following example that a file has changed and that it has some lines inserted.

  ```
  [master (root-commit) 54524e6] Added the initial file
  1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
  create mode 100644 DEVNET.txt
  ```

3. Use `git log` to view that commit.

  ```bash
  git log
  ```

<details>
<summary> Output </summary>
<pre><code>
commit 54524e69ab9d88cb11e4b1af4aee296c1777c0de (HEAD -> master)
Author: User Name <email@example.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 21:25:45 2020 +0000

    Added the initial file
</code></pre>
</details>

4. To verify that you've committed everything and Git knows all about it, try the `git status` command again.

  ```bash
  git status

  On branch master
  nothing to commit, working tree clean
  ```

  The phrase `working tree clean` means that Git has compared your file listing to what Git is tracking, and you have a clean slate with nothing new to report.

5. Now, you will send the new file to the remote GitHub repository. To do so, you will use the `git push` command to tell Git to update the `origin` remote with the `master` branch.

  ```bash
  git push origin master
  ```
  > *Note*: If you have 2FA enabled on your account, use your [authentication token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/authenticating-to-github/accessing-github-using-two-factor-authentication#using-two-factor-authentication-with-the-command-line) when prompted for a password.

6. In your web browser, check your repository on GitHub.com. You should see the `DEVNET.txt` file.
