# Viewing the differences between commits

Now that you have a few entries in the log, you can review changes between commits. You can do that with the command `git diff <commit> <commit>`.

1. Use the `git log` command to list the commits.

2. Select two commits and copy the first seven characters from the long ID. You can use the entire long ID if you want to, but the first seven characters simplify the process.

3. Use `git diff` and the hashes to compare the two commits.

  ⚠️ When you try out `git diff`, substitute the hashes of your own commits.

  ```bash
  git diff 6a6ee56 9369bf9
  ```

The output should be similar to the following example:

<details>
<summary> Output </summary>
<pre><code>
diff --git a/DEVNET.txt b/DEVNET.txt
index 2763ac1..e7afe9f 100644
