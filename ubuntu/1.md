# Configuring and initializing Git

To ensure that you can get credit (or blame) for the work that you've contributed, you need to associate your name and email address with your work. To do that in Git, you use the `git config` command.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Sample User"
git config --global user.email sample@example.com
git config --global core.pager cat
```

Now you're ready to start creating your code.

1. In the terminal window, navigate to the **src** folder with the `cd` ("change directory") command:

  ```bash
  cd ~/src
  ```

2. Create a directory called **git-intro** and `cd` into it:

  ```bash
  mkdir git-intro
  cd git-intro
  ```

4. Initialize the repository:

  ```bash
  git init
  ```

  You should see a message similar to the following:

  ```
  Initialized empty Git repository in /home/developer/src/git-intro/.git/
  ```

You have now created a local repository in your project directory. All of the repository's Git information, including change history, is contained in the hidden directory `.git`.
