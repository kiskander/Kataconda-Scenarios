# Checking your Git status

As you work on your project, you will want to see which files have changed.

Within the `git-intro` directory, type the command `git status`:

```bash
git status
```

> *Note:* In the Lab environment, you'll need to click on the highlighted box to view the output.

You should see a message similar to the following example:

<details>
<summary> Output </summary>
<pre><code>
On branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
</code></pre>
</details>

This message tells you the following information:

* You are on the default branch, `master`. We'll discuss branches later.
* The commit message is `Initial commit`.
* Currently, there are no changed files to commit.

You will see that the status of your repository changes after you add files and start making changes.
