# Committing changes

Now that you've staged your changes, you'll need to commit them to let Git know you want to start tracking those changes with `git commit`.

```bash
git commit -m "Updated DEVNET.txt with statment"
```

The `-m "<message>"` switch enables you to add a message explaining the changes you've made.

Git will respond with your commit message and additional information:

<details>
<summary> Output </summary>
<pre><code>
[master (root-commit) 6a6ee56] Updated DEVNET.txt with the truth
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 DEVNET.txt
</code></pre>
</details>

Note that the number and letter combination `6a6ee56` contained in `[master (root-commit) 6a6ee56]`. Your commit will have a different alphanumeric string. This string is a **hash**, and acts as a unique identifier for the commit.

**Now let's make a new commit before we move forward**
