# Working with branches

Branches are often used when implementing new features or hot fixes. Branches create a "safe space" for you to make changes, and will enable you to compare your work with the main code base.

## Creating a branch

To create a branch, execute the command `git branch <branch name>`.

```bash
git branch newBranch
```

To view a list of the branches that have been created, you can use `git branch`.

```bash
git branch
```

The output of `git branch` in this example should be similar to the following example:

<details>
<summary> Output </summary>
<pre><code>
$ git branch
newBranch
* master
</code></pre>
</details>

## Switching between branches

You now have 2 branches: `newBranch` and `master`. Now you need to switch to your branch`newBranch`. To switch between branches you can use `git checkout <branch name>`.

```bash
git checkout newBranch
```

Now that you're in `newBranch`, you can try making some changes. Add some text to your `DEVNET.txt` file.

```bash
echo "I'm a git guru now!" >> DEVNET.txt
```

Add and commit your change in this branch.

```bash
git add DEVNET.txt
git commit -m "Added a comment in DEVNET.txt under newBranch"
```

## Merging branches

Now you will merge the changes from `newBranch` into the `master` branch.

First, you need to switch to the `master` branch, then use the `git merge` command to merge the changes from `newBranch`.

```bash
git checkout master
git merge newBranch
```

The output of that command should be similar to the following example:

<details>
<summary> Output </summary>
<pre><code>
Updating 9369bf9..68853f1
Fast-forward
 DEVNET.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
</code></pre>
</details>

Open `DEVNET.txt` and you'll see that the merge was successful. You can delete `newBranch` with the `git branch` command, adding the `-d` flag to delete the branch:

```bash
git branch -d newBranch
```
