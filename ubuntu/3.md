# Adding files

You now have an initialized, but empty repository.

## Creating a file and viewing Git status

1. In the `git-intro` directory, create a file called `DEVNET.txt`:

  ```bash
  touch DEVNET.txt
  echo "I'm learning git!" > DEVNET.txt
  ```

2. List the files in the directory and verify that the `DEVNET.txt` file was successfully created:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

3. Type `git status` again.

  ```bash
  git status
  ```

  You should see a message similar to the following:

<details>
<summary> Output </summary>
<pre><code>
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        DEVNET.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
</code></pre>
</details>

Notice that `git` found the new file in the directory, and knows that it's not tracked.

## Staging changes

Next, we need to add `DEVNET.txt` to "stage" your work, and then "commit" your work.

1. Enter the command `git add DEVNET.txt` to "stage" the changed file:

  ```bash
  git add DEVNET.txt
  ```

2. Execute `git status` again.

  ```bash
  git status
  ```

  You should see a message similar to the following:

<details>
<summary> Output </summary>
<pre><code>
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   DEVNET.txt

</code></pre>
</details>

You can now see that there are "staged" changes in the form of `new file:   DEVNET.txt`.
